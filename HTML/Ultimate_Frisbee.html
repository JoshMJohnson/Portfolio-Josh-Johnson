            <p>
                <strong>Ultimate</strong>, originally known as <strong>Ultimate Frisbee</strong>, 
                is a <mark>non&ndash;contact team game</mark> played by players with a flying disc.
                Ultimate was developed in 1968 by a group of students at Columbia High School in Maplewood, New Jersey. 
                Although ultimate resembles many traditional sports in its athletic requirements, it is unlike most sports due to its 
                focus on self&ndash;officiating, even at the highest levels of competition. 
                The term Frisbee, often used to generically describe all flying discs, is a registered trademark of the Wham&ndash;O toy company, 
                and thus the sport is not formally called &ldquo;ultimate Frisbee&rdquo;, though this name is still in common casual use. Points are scored 
                by passing the disc to a teammate in the opposing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_zone" target="_blank">end zone</a>. Other basic rules are 
                that players must not take steps while holding the disc, and interceptions, incomplete passes, and passes out of bounds are turnovers. 
                Rain, wind, or occasionally other adversities can make for a testing match with rapid turnovers, heightening the pressure of play.
            </p>
            <p>
                From its beginnings in the American counterculture of the late 1960s, ultimate has resisted empowering any referee with rule enforcement. 
                Instead, it relies on the sportsmanship of players and invokes the &ldquo;spirit of the game&rdquo; to maintain fair play. Players call 
                their own fouls, and dispute a foul only when they genuinely believe it did not occur. Playing without referees is the norm for league play 
                but has been supplanted in club competition by the use of &ldquo;observers&rdquo; or &ldquo;game advisors&rdquo; to help in disputes, 
                and the professional league employs empowered referees.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2012, there were 5.1 million ultimate players in the United States. Ultimate is played across the world in pickup games and by 
                recreational, school, club, professional, and national teams at various age levels and with open, women&apos;s, and mixed divisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The United States has historically won most of the world titles, though not all. US teams won all three divisions &lpar;women&apos;s, men&apos;s, and mixed gender&rpar; 
                at the U&ndash;24 world championship in 2019, and all divisions in 2016 competitions between national teams

            <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_(sport)">
                I just remember one time running for a pass and leaping up in the air and just feeling the Frisbee making it into my hand and feeling 
                the perfect synchrony and the joy of the moment, and as I landed I said to myself, &lsquo;This is the ultimate game. This is the ultimate game.&rsquo;
                <span>&mdash;Jared Kass, one of the inventors of ultimate, interviewed in 2003, speaking of the summer of 1968</span>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Team flying disc games using pie tins and cake pan lids were part of Amherst College student culture for decades before plastic discs 
                were available. A similar two&ndash;hand, touch&ndash;football&ndash;based game was played at Kenyon College in Ohio starting in 1942.
            </p>
            <p>
                From 1965 or 1966 Jared Kass and fellow Amherst students Bob Fein, Richard Jacobson, Robert Marblestone, Steve Ward, Fred Hoxie, 
                Gordon Murray, and others evolved a team frisbee game based on concepts from American football, basketball, and soccer. 
                This game had some of the basics of modern ultimate including scoring by passing over a goal line, advancing the disc by passing, 
                no travelling with the disc, and turnovers on interceptions or incomplete passes. Kass, an instructor and dorm advisor, taught 
                this game to high school student <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Silver" target="_blank">Joel Silver</a> during the summer of 1967 
                or 1968 at Northfield Mount Hermon School summer camp.
            </p>
            <p>
                Joel Silver, along with fellow students Jonny Hines, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Hellring" target="_blank">Buzzy Hellring</a>, 
                and others, further developed ultimate beginning in 1968 
                at Columbia High School, Maplewood, New Jersey, USA &lpar;CHS&rpar;. The first sanctioned game was played at CHS in 1968 between the 
                student council and the student newspaper staff. Beginning the following year, evening games were played in the glow of 
                mercury&ndash;vapor lights on the school&apos;s student&ndash;designated parking lot. Initially players of ultimate Frisbee 
                &lpar;as it was known at the time&rpar; used a &ldquo;Master&rdquo; disc marketed by Wham&ndash;O, based on 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Frederick_Morrison" target="_blank">Fred Morrison&apos;s</a> inspired &ldquo;Pluto Platter&rdquo; design. 
                Hellring, Silver, and Hines developed the first and second edition of &ldquo;Rules of Ultimate Frisbee&rdquo;. In 1970 CHS defeated Millburn 
                High 43&ndash;10 in the first interscholastic ultimate game, which was played in the evening in the CHS&apos;s faculty parking lot.
                 Millburn, and three other New Jersey high schools made up the first conference of ultimate teams beginning in 1971.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alumni of that first league took the game to their colleges and universities. Rutgers defeated Princeton 29&ndash;27 in 1972 in the first 
                intercollegiate game. This game was played exactly 103 years after the first intercollegiate American football game by the same teams 
                at precisely the same site, which had been paved as a parking lot in the interim. Rutgers won both games by an identical margin.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rutgers also won the first ultimate Frisbee tournament in 1975, hosted by Yale, with 8 college teams participating. That summer 
                ultimate was introduced at the Second World Frisbee Championships at the Rose Bowl. This event introduced ultimate on the west coast of the US.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1975, ultimate was introduced at the Canadian Open Frisbee Championships in Toronto as a showcase event. Ultimate league play 
                in Canada began in Toronto in 1979.The Toronto Ultimate Club is one of ultimate&apos;s oldest leagues.
            </p>
            <p>
                In January 1977 Wham&ndash;O introduced the World Class &ldquo;80 Mold&rdquo; 165 gram frisbee. This disc quickly replaced the relatively light and 
                flimsy Master frisbee with much improved stability and consistency of throws even in windy conditions. Throws like the flick and 
                hammer were possible with greater control and accuracy with this sturdier disc. The 80 Mold was used in ultimate tournaments even 
                after it was discontinued in 1983.
            </p>
            <p>
                Discraft, founded in the late 1970s by Jim Kenner in London, Ontario, 
                later moved the company from Canada to its present location 
                in Wixom, Michigan. Discraft introduced the Ultrastar 175 gram disc in 1981, with an updated mold in 1983. This disc was adopted 
                as the standard for ultimate during the 1980s, with Wham&ndash;O holdouts frustrated by the discontinuation of the 80 mold and plastic 
                quality problems with discs made on the replacement 80e mold. Wham&ndash;O soon introduced a contending 175 gram disc, the U&ndash;Max, 
                that also suffered from quality problems and was never widely popular for ultimate. In 1991 the Ultrastar was specified as the official 
                disc for UPA tournament play and remains in wide use.
            </p>
            <p>
                The popularity of the sport spread quickly, taking hold as a free&ndash;spirited alternative to traditional organized sports. In recent 
                years college ultimate has attracted a greater number of traditional athletes, raising the level of competition and athleticism and 
                providing a challenge to its laid back, free&ndash;spirited roots.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2010, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Watson" target="_blank">Anne Watson</a>, a Vermont teacher and ultimate coach, launched a 
                seven&ndash;year effort to have ultimate recognized as full varsity sport in the state&apos;s high schools. Watson&apos;s effort culminated on 
                November 3, 2017, when the Vermont Principals Association, 
                which oversees the state&apos;s high school sports programs, unanimously approved ultimate as a varsity sport beginning in the Spring 
                2019 season. The approval made Vermont the first U.S. state to recognize ultimate as a varsity sport.

                In late December 1979, the first national player-run ultimate organization was founded in the United States as the Ultimate Players Association 
                &lpar;UPA&rpar;. Tom Kennedy was elected its first director. Before the UPA, events had been sponsored by the International Frisbee Association 
                &lpar;IFA&rpar;, a promotional arm of Wham&ndash;O. 
            </P>
            <p>
                The UPA organized regional tournaments and has crowned a national champion every year since 1979. Glassboro State College defeated the 
                Santa Barbara Condors 19&ndash;18 at the first UPA Nationals in 1979.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2010, the UPA rebranded itself as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Ultimate" target="_blank">USA Ultimate</a>

                The first European Championship tournament for national teams was held in 1980 in Paris. Finland won, with England and Sweden finishing 
                second and third. In 1981 the European Flying Disc Federation &lpar;EFDF&rpar; was formed. In 1984 the 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Flying_Disc_Federation" target="_blank">World Flying Disc Federation &lpar;WFDF&rpar;</a> was formed by the 
                EFDF to be the international governing body for disc sports. The first World Championships tournament was held in 1983 in Gothenburg, Sweden.

                A point is scored when one team catches the disc in the opposing team&apos;s end zone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each point begins with both teams lining up on the front of their respective end zone line. Standing beyond the end zone line before the disc is 
                thrown by the defense &lpar;a &ldquo;pull&rdquo;&rpar; to the offense is known as an &ldquo;offsides&rdquo; violation. A regulation grass outdoor 
                game has seven players per team. In mixed ultimate, the teams usually play with a &ldquo;4&ndash;3&rdquo; ratio, meaning either 4 men and 3 women or 4 women and 3 
                men will be playing. The offensive end zone dictates whether there are more men or women. This end zone is called the &lsquo;gen&ndash;zone&rsquo;, short for gender zone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each point begins with the two teams starting in opposite end zones. The team who scored the previous point are now on defense. The teams indicate 
                their readiness by raising a hand, and the team on defense will throw the disc to the other team. This throw is called a &ldquo;pull&rdquo;. When the pull is released, 
                all players are free to leave their end zones and occupy any area on the field. Both teams should not leave the end&ndash;zone before the pull is released. 
                Thus, the defending team must run most of the field length at speed to defend immediately, and a good pull is designed to hang in the air as long as 
                possible to give the defending team time to make the run. To score goals, the players of each team try to get the possession of the flying disc 
                &lpar;without making physical contact with players&rpar;, pass it from one teammate to the other, and keep it away from the opponents till it is carried all the way 
                towards their &lpar;opponents&apos;&rpar; end zone or goal area. Each end&ndash;zone lies at each end of the court.
            </p>
            <p>
                The player holding the disc must establish a pivot point &lpar;i.e. they cannot run with the disc, just step out from a single point&rpar;. They must establish a 
                pivot at &ldquo;the appropriate spot&rdquo; on the field &lpar;where they caught the disc, or as soon as possible after slowing down&rpar;. The player can also catch and throw 
                the disc within three steps without establishing a pivot. A violation of these rules is called a &ldquo;travel&rdquo;. The disc is advanced by throwing it to teammates. 
                If a pass is incomplete, it is a &ldquo;turnover&rdquo; and the opposing team immediately gains possession, playing to score in the opposite direction. Passes are 
                incomplete if they are caught by a defender, touch the ground &lpar;meaning defenders need only knock the disc out of the air to gain possession&rpar;, or touch an 
                out&ndash;of&ndash;bounds object before being caught. The first body part to touch the ground is the one considered for bounds, which means a player may catch the 
                disc and &lsquo;toe the line&rsquo;, or put a foot down, before falling out of bounds. Once possession of the disc is obtained, however, it cannot be forced out of the 
                throwers possession before it leaves their hand. A common infraction of this nature is called a &ldquo;strip&rdquo;, in which one player feels that they had enough 
                possession of the disc to stop its rotation before it was taken out of their hand. However, if a player jumps from in bounds, catches, and then throws the 
                disc while in the air and technically out of bounds, the disc is still in play and can be caught or defended by players on the field. This feat of athleticism 
                and precision is highly praised, and dubbed &ldquo;Greatest.&rdquo;

                Ultimate is non&ndash;contact. Non&ndash;incidental, play&ndash;affecting, or dangerous physical contact is not allowed. Non&ndash;incidental contact is a foul, 
                regardless of intent, with various consequences depending on the situation and the league rules. Incidental contact, like minor collisions while jumping 
                for the disc or running for it can be acceptable, depending on the circumstances. Parameters like who has the &ldquo;right&rdquo; for the relevant space, 
                who caught the disc etc. will determine whether a foul has been committed or not. Attitudes can vary between leagues and countries, even if 
                the letter of the rule remains the same. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Contact is disallowed for both defence and offence, including the defender marking the offense player with the disc, and there are further restrictions on 
                positions this defender can take in order to minimize incidental contact.
            </p>
            <p>
                Defending against the person who has the disc is a central part of the defensive strategy &lpar;colloquially &ldquo;marking&rdquo;&rpar;. The defensive &ldquo;marker&rdquo; 
                counts aloud to 10 seconds, which is referred to as &ldquo;stalling&rdquo;. If the disc has not been thrown when the defending player reaches 10, it is turned over to 
                the other team. &ldquo;Stall&rdquo; can only be called after the defender has actually counted the 10 seconds. In order for the &ldquo;mark&rdquo; to be considered 
                as counting all the way to ten, the thrower must throw the disc before the mark is able to say the &ldquo;T&rdquo; in the word ten. If the mark is accused of counting 
                too fast &lpar;called a "fast-count"&rpar;, then the thrower can call a violation, in which the mark then has to subtract two seconds from their previous stall 
                count and slow their counting. There can only be one player defending in a 3 meters &lpar;9.8 ft&rpar; radius around the person who has the disc unless that player 
                is defending against another offensive player. The marker must stay one disc&apos;s diameter away from the thrower and must not wrap their hands around the 
                thrower, or the person with the disc can call a foul &lpar;&ldquo;wrapping&rdquo;&rpar;.
            </p>
            <p>
                In ultimate, there is no concept of intentional vs. unintentional fouls&colon; infractions are called by the players themselves and resolved in such a way as to 
                minimize the impact of such calls on the outcome of the play &lpar;sometimes resulting in &ldquo;do-overs&rdquo; where the disc is returned to the last uncontested 
                possession&rpar;, rather than emphasizing penalties or &ldquo;win&ndash;at&ndash;all&ndash;costs&rdquo; behavior. If a player disagrees with a foul that 
                was called on them, they can choose to &ldquo;contest&rdquo; the infraction. In many instances, a conversation ensues between both parties involved in 
                the foul, and a verdict is determined as to whether the disc will be returned and a &ldquo;do&ndash;over&rdquo; will commence, or if the person guilty of 
                the foul has no objections to the call. A common infraction, intentional or not, is a &ldquo;pick&rdquo; where the offense &lpar;or your own team member even&rpar; 
                is somehow in the way of your pursuit of your &ldquo;check&rdquo; in man&ndash;to&ndash;man defense. This only applies when you started within 10 feet of your 
                &ldquo;check&rdquo; and the game play is stopped so that the players involved go back to where the &ldquo;pick&rdquo; occurred. The integrity of 
                ultimate depends on each player&apos;s responsibility to uphold the spirit of the game. Ultimate is predominantly self&ndash;refereed, relying on the on&ndash;field 
                players to call their own infractions and to try their best to play within the rules of the game. It is assumed that players will not intentionally violate the rules and 
                will be honest when discussing foul calls with opponents. This is called Spirit of the Game, or simply Spirit. After a call is made, the players should agree 
                on an outcome, based on what they think happened and how the rules apply to that situation. If players cannot come to agreement on the call&apos;s validity, 
                the disc can be given back to the last uncontested thrower, with play restarting as if before the disputed throw. Coaches and other players on the sidelines 
                cannot make calls, however they may inform players of specific rules in the case of a contested call. Players on the sideline may also be asked for their view, 
                as they often have &ldquo;best perspective&rdquo; to see what happened.

                A regulation outdoor game is played 7 vs. 7, with substitutions allowed between points and for injuries. Games are typically played to a points limit of 13&sol;15&sol;17 
                or more, and&sol;or a time limit of 75&sol;90&sol;100 minutes. There is usually a halftime break and an allowance of a 2 timeouts per team each half.

                Competitive ultimate is played in gender divisions using gender determination rules based on those of the IOC. Different competitions may have a 
                &ldquo;men&apos;s&rdquo; or an &ldquo;open&rdquo; division &lpar;the latter usually being extremely male&ndash;dominated at competitive levels, 
                but technically unrestricted&rpar;. Mixed is officially played with 4 of one gender and 3 of the other, but variants exist for different numbers. 
                Men&apos;s, women&apos;s, and mixed ultimate are played by the same rules besides those explicitly dealing with gender restrictions.

                American Ultimate Disc League &lpar;AUDL&rpar;, the semi&ndash;professional ultimate league with teams in the U.S. and Canada, has its own variant of 
                the rules, and has made multiple rule changes in recent years. Some of the more important include&colon;
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Slightly larger field dimensions</li>
                <li>Shorter, 20&ndash;yard end zones</li>
                <li>
                    In WFDF, games are played to X points with two halves and global time caps. In the AUDL, the game is played in four quarters of 12&colon;00 minutes each. 
                    The counted times is only when the disc is in actual play, resulting in games lasting over two hours at times. The game stops on the timed second, 
                    rather than at the end of the point. At this point the disc is still allowed to be caught, which can result in &ldquo;buzzer beater&rdquo; or 
                    &ldquo;in&ndash;bound Greatest&rdquo; attempts, where players attempt to throw the disc right before the time ends
                </li>
                <li>
                    Referees making calls instead of players. Players may invoke the &ldquo;integrity rule&rdquo; and overrule the referees&apos; 
                    call when the players call is against their own team
                </li>
                <li>Most fouls are penalized with a 10&ndash;yard or 20&ndash;yard move of position against the fouling team</li>
                <li>Double&ndash;teaming is allowed, but not triple&ndash;teaming</li>
                <li>Stall count is 7 seconds instead of 10 seconds</li>
                <li>Stall count is counted by the referees rather than the marking player</li>

            <h2 class="header">Throwing and Catching Techniques</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                A player may catch the disc with one or two hands. A catch can grab the rim with one or two hands, or simultaneously grab the top and bottom of the 
                frisbee &mdash; in a clap&ndash;catch &sol; &ldquo;pancake catch&rdquo;. Care is needed with the hand placement when catching with one hand on 
                the disc rim, making sure to catch on the proper side of the disc, according to which way the disc is spinning. When a frisbee is thrown at 
                high speeds, as is frequently the case in a competitive game of ultimate, one side of the disc can spin out of the player&apos;s hand, and 
                the other side can spin into their hand, which can make a catch far more secure. For this reason, along with the desire to secure the frisbee 
                strongly and &ldquo;cleanly&rdquo;, the general advice is to strongly prefer to catch with two hands if possible. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The most popular throws are <i>backhand</i>, and <i>forehand&sol;flick</i> and less frequently, <i>hammer</i> and <i>scoober</i>, <i>push&ndash;passes</i>, 
                and <i>weak&ndash;handed throws</i> &lpar;typically lefties&rpar;. Part of the area of ultimate where skill and strategy meet is a player&apos;s 
                capacity to plot and execute on throwing and passing to outrun another team, which is colloquially known as &ldquo;being a deep threat&rdquo;. For 
                example, multiple throwing techniques and the ability to pass the disc before the defense has had a chance to reset helps increase a player or 
                team&apos;s threat level, and merging that with speed and coordinated plays can form a phalanx that is hard for competitors to overcome.
            </p>
            <p>
                When referencing the curve of a throw, the terms outside&ndash;in &lpar;OI&rpar; and inside&ndash;out &lpar;IO&rpar; are used. An OI throw is 
                one that curves in towards the opposite side of the throwers body from which it is thrown. An IO throw is one that curves toward the same 
                side of the throwers body from which it is thrown. With the rotation of the disc in mind, an IO throw has the side of the disc rotating 
                toward the direction of the throw angled to the ground, whereas an OI throw has the side of the disc rotating toward the thrower angled 
                to the ground. IO throws are generally the more difficult throw, and are very useful for breaking the mark.
            </p>
            <p>
                Apart from these formal strategies, there is also a freestyle practice, where players throw and catch with fewer limitations, 
                in order to advance their ultimate handling skills.
