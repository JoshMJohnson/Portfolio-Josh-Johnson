            <p>
                <strong>Ultimate</strong>, originally known as <strong>Ultimate Frisbee</strong>, 
                is a <mark>non&ndash;contact team game</mark> played by players with a flying disc.
                Ultimate was developed in 1968 by a group of students at Columbia High School in Maplewood, New Jersey. 
                Although ultimate resembles many traditional sports in its athletic requirements, it is unlike most sports due to its 
                focus on self&ndash;officiating, even at the highest levels of competition. 
                The term Frisbee, often used to generically describe all flying discs, is a registered trademark of the Wham&ndash;O toy company, 
                and thus the sport is not formally called &ldquo;ultimate Frisbee&rdquo;, though this name is still in common casual use. Points are scored 
                by passing the disc to a teammate in the opposing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_zone" target="_blank">end zone</a>. Other basic rules are 
                that players must not take steps while holding the disc, and interceptions, incomplete passes, and passes out of bounds are turnovers. 
                Rain, wind, or occasionally other adversities can make for a testing match with rapid turnovers, heightening the pressure of play.
            </p>
            <p>
                From its beginnings in the American counterculture of the late 1960s, ultimate has resisted empowering any referee with rule enforcement. 
                Instead, it relies on the sportsmanship of players and invokes the &ldquo;spirit of the game&rdquo; to maintain fair play. Players call 
                their own fouls, and dispute a foul only when they genuinely believe it did not occur. Playing without referees is the norm for league play 
                but has been supplanted in club competition by the use of &ldquo;observers&rdquo; or &ldquo;game advisors&rdquo; to help in disputes, 
                and the professional league employs empowered referees.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2012, there were 5.1 million ultimate players in the United States. Ultimate is played across the world in pickup games and by 
                recreational, school, club, professional, and national teams at various age levels and with open, women&apos;s, and mixed divisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The United States has historically won most of the world titles, though not all. US teams won all three divisions &lpar;women&apos;s, 
                men&apos;s, and mixed gender&rpar; at the U&ndash;24 world championship in 2019, and all divisions in 2016 competitions between national teams

                I just remember one time running for a pass and leaping up in the air and just feeling the Frisbee making it into my hand and feeling 
                the perfect synchrony and the joy of the moment, and as I landed I said to myself, &lsquo;This is the ultimate game. This is the ultimate game.&rsquo;
                <span>&mdash;Jared Kass, one of the inventors of ultimate, interviewed in 2003, speaking of the summer of 1968</span>
            </blockquote>

                Team flying disc games using pie tins and cake pan lids were part of Amherst College student culture for decades before plastic discs 
                were available. A similar two&ndash;hand, touch&ndash;football&ndash;based game was played at Kenyon College in Ohio starting in 1942.
            </p>
            <p>
                From 1965 or 1966 Jared Kass and fellow Amherst students Bob Fein, Richard Jacobson, Robert Marblestone, Steve Ward, Fred Hoxie, 
                Gordon Murray, and others evolved a team frisbee game based on concepts from American football, basketball, and soccer. 
                This game had some of the basics of modern ultimate including scoring by passing over a goal line, advancing the disc by passing, 
                no travelling with the disc, and turnovers on interceptions or incomplete passes. Kass, an instructor and dorm advisor, taught 
                this game to high school student <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Silver" target="_blank">Joel Silver</a> during the summer of 1967 
                or 1968 at Northfield Mount Hermon School summer camp.
            </p>
            <p>
                Joel Silver, along with fellow students Jonny Hines, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Hellring" target="_blank">Buzzy Hellring</a>, 
                and others, further developed ultimate beginning in 1968 
                at Columbia High School, Maplewood, New Jersey, USA &lpar;CHS&rpar;. The first sanctioned game was played at CHS in 1968 between the 
                student council and the student newspaper staff. Beginning the following year, evening games were played in the glow of 
                mercury&ndash;vapor lights on the school&apos;s student&ndash;designated parking lot. Initially players of ultimate Frisbee 
                &lpar;as it was known at the time&rpar; used a &ldquo;Master&rdquo; disc marketed by Wham&ndash;O, based on 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Frederick_Morrison" target="_blank">Fred Morrison&apos;s</a> inspired &ldquo;Pluto Platter&rdquo; design. 
                Hellring, Silver, and Hines developed the first and second edition of &ldquo;Rules of Ultimate Frisbee&rdquo;. In 1970 CHS defeated Millburn 
                High 43&ndash;10 in the first interscholastic ultimate game, which was played in the evening in the CHS&apos;s faculty parking lot. 
                Millburn, and three other New Jersey high schools made up the first conference of ultimate teams beginning in 1971.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alumni of that first league took the game to their colleges and universities. Rutgers defeated Princeton 29&ndash;27 in 1972 in the first 
                intercollegiate game. This game was played exactly 103 years after the first intercollegiate American football game by the same teams 
                at precisely the same site, which had been paved as a parking lot in the interim. Rutgers won both games by an identical margin.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rutgers also won the first ultimate Frisbee tournament in 1975, hosted by Yale, with 8 college teams participating. That summer 
                ultimate was introduced at the Second World Frisbee Championships at the Rose Bowl. This event introduced ultimate on the west coast of the US.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1975, ultimate was introduced at the Canadian Open Frisbee Championships in Toronto as a showcase event. Ultimate league play 
                in Canada began in Toronto in 1979.The Toronto Ultimate Club is one of ultimate&apos;s oldest leagues.

                In January 1977 Wham&ndash;O introduced the World Class &ldquo;80 Mold&rdquo; 165 gram frisbee. This disc quickly replaced the relatively light and 
                flimsy Master frisbee with much improved stability and consistency of throws even in windy conditions. Throws like the flick and 
                hammer were possible with greater control and accuracy with this sturdier disc. The 80 Mold was used in ultimate tournaments even 
                after it was discontinued in 1983.
            </p>
            <p>
                Discraft, founded in the late 1970s by Jim Kenner in London, Ontario, 
                later moved the company from Canada to its present location 
                in Wixom, Michigan. Discraft introduced the Ultrastar 175 gram disc in 1981, with an updated mold in 1983. This disc was adopted 
                as the standard for ultimate during the 1980s, with Wham&ndash;O holdouts frustrated by the discontinuation of the 80 mold and plastic 
                quality problems with discs made on the replacement 80e mold. Wham&ndash;O soon introduced a contending 175 gram disc, the U&ndash;Max, 
                that also suffered from quality problems and was never widely popular for ultimate. In 1991 the Ultrastar was specified as the official 
                disc for UPA tournament play and remains in wide use.
            </p>
            <p>
                The popularity of the sport spread quickly, taking hold as a free&ndash;spirited alternative to traditional organized sports. In recent 
                years college ultimate has attracted a greater number of traditional athletes, raising the level of competition and athleticism and 
                providing a challenge to its laid back, free&ndash;spirited roots.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2010, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Watson" target="_blank">Anne Watson</a>, a Vermont teacher and ultimate coach, launched a 
                seven&ndash;year effort to have ultimate recognized as full varsity sport in the state&apos;s high schools. Watson&apos;s effort culminated on 
                November 3, 2017, when the Vermont Principals Association, which oversees the state&apos;s high school sports programs, 
                unanimously approved ultimate as a varsity sport beginning in the Spring 2019 season. The approval made Vermont the first U.S. 
                state to recognize ultimate as a varsity sport.

                Each point begins with both teams lining up on the front of their respective end zone line. Standing beyond the end zone line before the disc is

                game has seven players per team. In mixed ultimate, the teams usually play with a &ldquo;4&ndash;3&rdquo; ratio, meaning either 4 men and 3 women or 4 women and 3 
                men will be playing. The offensive end zone dictates whether there are more men or women. This end zone is called the &lsquo;gen&ndash;zone&rsquo;, short for gender zone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each point begins with the two teams starting in opposite end zones. The team who scored the previous point are now on defense. The teams indicate 
                their readiness by raising a hand, and the team on defense will throw the disc to the other team. This throw is called a &ldquo;pull&rdquo;. When the pull is released, 
                all players are free to leave their end zones and occupy any area on the field. Both teams should not leave the end&ndash;zone before the pull is released. 
                Thus, the defending team must run most of the field length at speed to defend immediately, and a good pull is designed to hang in the air as long as 
                possible to give the defending team time to make the run. To score goals, the players of each team try to get the possession of the flying disc 
                &lpar;without making physical contact with players&rpar;, pass it from one teammate to the other, and keep it away from the opponents till it is carried all the way 
                towards their &lpar;opponents&apos;&rpar; end zone or goal area. Each end&ndash;zone lies at each end of the court.
            </p>
            <p>
                The player holding the disc must establish a pivot point &lpar;i.e. they cannot run with the disc, just step out from a single point&rpar;. They must establish a 
                pivot at &ldquo;the appropriate spot&rdquo; on the field &lpar;where they caught the disc, or as soon as possible after slowing down&rpar;. The player can also catch and throw 
                the disc within three steps without establishing a pivot. A violation of these rules is called a &ldquo;travel&rdquo;. The disc is advanced by throwing it to teammates. 
                If a pass is incomplete, it is a &ldquo;turnover&rdquo; and the opposing team immediately gains possession, playing to score in the opposite direction. Passes are 
                incomplete if they are caught by a defender, touch the ground &lpar;meaning defenders need only knock the disc out of the air to gain possession&rpar;, or touch an 
                out&ndash;of&ndash;bounds object before being caught. The first body part to touch the ground is the one considered for bounds, which means a player may catch the 
                disc and &lsquo;toe the line&rsquo;, or put a foot down, before falling out of bounds. Once possession of the disc is obtained, however, it cannot be forced out of the 
                throwers possession before it leaves their hand. A common infraction of this nature is called a &ldquo;strip&rdquo;, in which one player feels that they had enough 
                possession of the disc to stop its rotation before it was taken out of their hand. However, if a player jumps from in bounds, catches, and then throws the 
                disc while in the air and technically out of bounds, the disc is still in play and can be caught or defended by players on the field. This feat of athleticism 
                and precision is highly praised, and dubbed &ldquo;Greatest.&rdquo;

                Ultimate is non&ndash;contact. Non&ndash;incidental, play&ndash;affecting, or dangerous physical contact is not allowed. Non&ndash;incidental contact is a foul, 
                regardless of intent, with various consequences depending on the situation and the league rules. Incidental contact, like minor collisions while jumping 
                for the disc or running for it can be acceptable, depending on the circumstances. Parameters like who has the &ldquo;right&rdquo; for the relevant space, 
                who caught the disc etc. will determine whether a foul has been committed or not. Attitudes can vary between leagues and countries, even if 
                the letter of the rule remains the same. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Contact is disallowed for both defence and offence, including the defender marking the offense player with the disc, and there are further restrictions on 
                positions this defender can take in order to minimize incidental contact.
            </p>
            <p>
                Defending against the person who has the disc is a central part of the defensive strategy &lpar;colloquially &ldquo;marking&rdquo;&rpar;. The defensive &ldquo;marker&rdquo; 
                counts aloud to 10 seconds, which is referred to as &ldquo;stalling&rdquo;. If the disc has not been thrown when the defending player reaches 10, it is turned over to 
                the other team. &ldquo;Stall&rdquo; can only be called after the defender has actually counted the 10 seconds. In order for the &ldquo;mark&rdquo; to be considered 
                as counting all the way to ten, the thrower must throw the disc before the mark is able to say the &ldquo;T&rdquo; in the word ten. If the mark is accused of counting 
                too fast &lpar;called a &ldquo;fast&ndash;count&rdquo;&rpar;, then the thrower can call a violation, in which the mark then has to subtract two seconds from their previous stall 
                count and slow their counting. There can only be one player defending in a 3 meters &lpar;9.8 ft&rpar; radius around the person who has the disc unless that player 
                is defending against another offensive player. The marker must stay one disc&apos;s diameter away from the thrower and must not wrap their hands around the 
                thrower, or the person with the disc can call a foul &lpar;&ldquo;wrapping&rdquo;&rpar;.
            </p>
            <p>
                In ultimate, there is no concept of intentional vs. unintentional fouls&colon; infractions are called by the players themselves and resolved in such a way as to 
                minimize the impact of such calls on the outcome of the play &lpar;sometimes resulting in &ldquo;do&ndash;overs&rdquo; where the disc is returned to the last uncontested 
                possession&rpar;, rather than emphasizing penalties or &ldquo;win&ndash;at&ndash;all&ndash;costs&rdquo; behavior. If a player disagrees with a foul that 
                was called on them, they can choose to &ldquo;contest&rdquo; the infraction. In many instances, a conversation ensues between both parties involved in 
                the foul, and a verdict is determined as to whether the disc will be returned and a &ldquo;do&ndash;over&rdquo; will commence, or if the person guilty of 
                the foul has no objections to the call. A common infraction, intentional or not, is a &ldquo;pick&rdquo; where the offense &lpar;or your own team member even&rpar; 
                is somehow in the way of your pursuit of your &ldquo;check&rdquo; in man&ndash;to&ndash;man defense. This only applies when you started within 10 feet of your 
                &ldquo;check&rdquo; and the game play is stopped so that the players involved go back to where the &ldquo;pick&rdquo; occurred. The integrity of 
                ultimate depends on each player&apos;s responsibility to uphold the spirit of the game. Ultimate is predominantly self&ndash;refereed, relying on the on&ndash;field 
                players to call their own infractions and to try their best to play within the rules of the game. It is assumed that players will not intentionally violate the rules and 
                will be honest when discussing foul calls with opponents. This is called Spirit of the Game, or simply Spirit. After a call is made, the players should agree 
                on an outcome, based on what they think happened and how the rules apply to that situation. If players cannot come to agreement on the call&apos;s validity, 
                the disc can be given back to the last uncontested thrower, with play restarting as if before the disputed throw. Coaches and other players on the sidelines 
                cannot make calls, however they may inform players of specific rules in the case of a contested call. Players on the sideline may also be asked for their view, 
                as they often have &ldquo;best perspective&rdquo; to see what happened.

                A regulation outdoor game is played 7 vs. 7, with substitutions allowed between points and for injuries. Games are typically played to a points limit of 13&sol;15&sol;17 
                or more, and&sol;or a time limit of 75&sol;90&sol;100 minutes. There is usually a halftime break and an allowance of a 2 timeouts per team each half.

                Competitive ultimate is played in gender divisions using gender determination rules based on those of the IOC. Different competitions may have a 
                &ldquo;men&apos;s&rdquo; or an &ldquo;open&rdquo; division &lpar;the latter usually being extremely male&ndash;dominated at competitive levels, 
                but technically unrestricted&rpar;. Mixed is officially played with 4 of one gender and 3 of the other, but variants exist for different numbers. 
                Men&apos;s, women&apos;s, and mixed ultimate are played by the same rules besides those explicitly dealing with gender restrictions.

                American Ultimate Disc League &lpar;AUDL&rpar;, the semi&ndash;professional ultimate league with teams in the U.S. and Canada, has its own variant of 
                the rules, and has made multiple rule changes in recent years. Some of the more important include&colon;
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Slightly larger field dimensions</li>
                <li>Shorter, 20&ndash;yard end zones</li>
                <li>In WFDF, games are played to X points with two halves and global time caps. In the AUDL, the game is played in four quarters of 12&colon;00 minutes each. 
                    The counted times is only when the disc is in actual play, resulting in games lasting over two hours at times. The game stops on the timed second, 
                    rather than at the end of the point. At this point the disc is still allowed to be caught, which can result in &ldquo;buzzer beater&rdquo; or 
                    &ldquo;in&ndash;bound Greatest&rdquo; attempts, where players attempt to throw the disc right before the time ends
                </li>
                <li>Referees making calls instead of players. Players may invoke the &ldquo;integrity rule&rdquo; and overrule the referees&apos;

            <h2 class="header" id="throwing_and_catching">Throwing and Catching Techniques</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                A player may catch the disc with one or two hands. A catch can grab the rim with one or two hands, or simultaneously grab the top and bottom of the 
                frisbee &mdash; in a clap&ndash;catch &sol; &ldquo;pancake catch&rdquo;. Care is needed with the hand placement when catching with one hand on 
                the disc rim, making sure to catch on the proper side of the disc, according to which way the disc is spinning. When a frisbee is thrown at 
                high speeds, as is frequently the case in a competitive game of ultimate, one side of the disc can spin out of the player&apos;s hand, and 
                the other side can spin into their hand, which can make a catch far more secure. For this reason, along with the desire to secure the frisbee 
                strongly and &ldquo;cleanly&rdquo;, the general advice is to strongly prefer to catch with two hands if possible. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The most popular throws are <i>backhand</i>, and <i>forehand&sol;flick</i> and less frequently, <i>hammer</i> and <i>scoober</i>, <i>push&ndash;passes</i>, 
                and <i>weak&ndash;handed throws</i> &lpar;typically lefties&rpar;. Part of the area of ultimate where skill and strategy meet is a player&apos;s 
                capacity to plot and execute on throwing and passing to outrun another team, which is colloquially known as &ldquo;being a deep threat&rdquo;. For 
                example, multiple throwing techniques and the ability to pass the disc before the defense has had a chance to reset helps increase a player or 
                team&apos;s threat level, and merging that with speed and coordinated plays can form a phalanx that is hard for competitors to overcome.
            </p>
            <p>
                When referencing the curve of a throw, the terms outside&ndash;in &lpar;OI&rpar; and inside&ndash;out &lpar;IO&rpar; are used. An OI throw is 
                one that curves in towards the opposite side of the throwers body from which it is thrown. An IO throw is one that curves toward the same 
                side of the throwers body from which it is thrown. With the rotation of the disc in mind, an IO throw has the side of the disc rotating 
                toward the direction of the throw angled to the ground, whereas an OI throw has the side of the disc rotating toward the thrower angled 
                to the ground. IO throws are generally the more difficult throw, and are very useful for breaking the mark.
            </p>
            <p>
                Apart from these formal strategies, there is also a freestyle practice, where players throw and catch with fewer limitations, 
                in order to advance their ultimate handling skills.

                Teams can employ many different offensive strategies, each with distinct goals. Most basic strategies are an attempt to create open space 
                &lpar;e.g. lanes&rpar; on the field in which the thrower and receiver can complete a pass. Organized teams assign positions to the players based on 
                their specific strengths. Designated throwers are called handlers and designated receivers are called cutters. The amount of autonomy or 
                overlap between these positions depends on the make&ndash;up of the team.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many advanced teams develop variations on the basic offenses to take advantage of the strengths of specific players. Frequently, these 
                offenses are meant to isolate a few key players in one&ndash;on&ndash;one situations, allowing them to take advantage of mismatches, while the others 
                play a supporting role.
            </p>
            <h4 class="header" id="handlers_cutters">Handlers And Cutters</h4>
            <p>
                In most settings, there are a few &ldquo;handlers&rdquo; which are the players positioned around the disc. Their task is to distribute the disc forward and 
                provide easy receiving options to whoever has the disc. Cutters, are the players positioned downfield, whose job is usually to catch the disc 
                farther afield and progress the disc through the field or score goals by catching the disc in the end zone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Typically, when the offense is playing against a zone defense the cutters will be assigned positions based on their location on the field, 
                oftentimes referred to as &ldquo;poppers and rails &lpar;or deep deeps&rpar;.&rdquo; Poppers will typically make cuts within 15 yards of the handler positions 
                while rails alternate between longer movements downfield. Additionally, against a zone there are typically three or four instead of the usual 
                two or three, depending on the team.
            </p>
            <h4 class="header" id="vertical_stack">Vertical Stack</h4>
            <figure id="vertical_stack_display">
                <img src="Images/vertical_stack.png" alt="vertical stack visual">
                <figcaption>The standard configuartion for a vertical stack &lpar;offence and force&frasl;one&ndash;to&ndash;defense&rpar;</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                One of the most common offensive strategies is the vertical stack. In this strategy, a number of offensive players line up between the disc 
                and the end zone they are attacking. From this position, players in the stack make cuts &lpar;sudden sprints, usually after throwing off the 
                defender by a &ldquo;fake&rdquo; move the other way&rpar; into the space available, attempting to get open and receive the disc. 
                The stack generally lines up in the middle of the field, thereby opening up two lanes along the sidelines for cuts, although a captain may 
                occasionally call for the stack to line up closer to one sideline, leaving open just one larger cutting lane on the other side. 
                Variations of the vertical stack include the Side Stack, where the stack is moved to a sideline and one player is isolated 
                in the open space, and the Split Stack, where players are split between two stacks, one on either sideline. The Side Stack 
                is most helpful in an end zone play where your players line up on one side of the end zone and the handler calls an &lpar;ISO&rpar; 
                &lpar;isolation&rpar; using one of the player&apos;s names. This then signals for 
                the rest of the players on your team to clear away from that one person in order for them to receive a pass. Another variation is 
                called Cascades, which starts by setting a side stack. Then, the player at the top or bottom of the stack cuts, using the large amount 
                of available space. Once the initial cutter has finished &lpar;whether they caught the disc or if they were waved away by the handler&rpar;, 
                then the next cutter in line continues. In vertical stack offenses, one player usually plays the role of &lsquo;dump&rsquo;, offering a reset 
                option which sets up behind the player with the disc.
            </p>
            <h4 class="header" id="horizontal_stack">Horizontal Stack</h4>
            <p>
                Another popular offensive strategy is the horizontal stack, also called &ldquo;ho&ndash;stack&rdquo;. In the most popular form of this offense, three 
                &ldquo;handlers&rdquo; line up across the width of the field with four &ldquo;cutters&rdquo; downfield, spaced evenly across the field. This formation 
                encourages cutters to attack any of the space either towards or away from the disc, granting each cutter access to the full width 
                of the field and thereby allowing a degree more creativity than is possible with a vertical stack. If cutters cannot get open, the 
                handlers swing the disc side to side to reset the stall count and in an attempt to get the defense out of position. Usually players 
                will cut towards the disc at an angle and away from the disc straight, creating a &lsquo;diamond&rsquo; or &lsquo;peppermill&rsquo; pattern.
            </p>
            <h4 class="header" id="fgi">Feature, German, or Isolation</h4>
            <p>
                A variation on the horizontal stack offense is called a feature, German, or isolation &lpar;or &ldquo;iso&rdquo; for short&rpar;. In this offensive 
                strategy three of the cutters line up deeper than usual &lpar;this can vary from 5 yards farther downfield to at the endzone&rpar; while 
                the remaining cutter lines up closer to the handlers. This closest cutter is known as the &ldquo;feature&rdquo;, or &ldquo;German&rdquo;. The idea 
                behind this strategy is that it opens up space for the feature to cut, and at the same time it allows handlers to focus all 
                of their attention on only one cutter. This maximizes the ability for give&ndash;and&ndash;go strategies between the feature and the 
                handlers. It is also an excellent strategy if one cutter is superior to other cutters, or if they are guarded by someone 
                slower than them. While the main focus is on the handlers and the feature, the remaining three cutters can be used if the 
                feature cannot get open, if there is an open deep look, or for a continuation throw from the feature itself. Typically, 
                however, these three remaining cutters do all they can to get out of the feature&apos;s way. It is usually used near the endzone.
            </p>
            <h4 class="header" id="hexagon_mexican">Hexagon or Mexican</h4>
            <p>
                A newer strategy, credited to Felix Shardlow from the Brighton Ultimate team, is called Hexagon Offence. Players spread out 
                in equilateral triangles, creating a hexagon shape with one player &lpar;usually not the thrower&rpar; in the middle. They create space 
                for each other dynamically, aiming to keep the disc moving by taking the open pass in any direction. This changes the angles 
                of attack rapidly, and hopes to create and exploit holes in the defense. Hex aims to generate and maintain flow to lead to scoring opportunities.

            </figure>
            <p>
                The pull is the first throw of the game and also begins each period of play. A good, accurate pull is an important part of a 
                defensive strategy. The optimal pull has two features&colon;
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>To start the offense as deep into their own end&ndash;zone as possible, giving the offense more distance to cover</li>
                <li>To stay in the air as long as possible, giving the defense more time to get set up before 
                    the first offensive pass, or in the case of a deep end&ndash;zone pull, chooses to run up to the front of their end&ndash;zone line and begin 
                    their offense at yard zero
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>A pull is not limited to any certain throw. However, most players use the inside out backhand throw to achieve maximum hang time.</p>
            <p>
                There is no pivot required for a pull. The offensive team must have at least one foot on the goal line and must not change 
                their position until the disc has left the thrower&apos;s hand. The defensive team must stay behind the &lsquo;puller&rsquo; until the disc 
                is released, or it is considered &lsquo;offside&rsquo;. The defensive team is not allowed to touch the disc until it has been touched 
                by the opposing team or has touched the ground. A pull that is touched midair by the offense, but is not caught, results in a turnover.
            </p>
            <h4 class="header" id="force">Force</h4>
            <p>
                One of the most basic defensive principles is the &ldquo;force&rdquo; or &ldquo;mark&rdquo;. The defender marking the thrower essentially tries to force 
                them to throw in a particular direction &lpar;to the &ldquo;force side&rdquo; or &ldquo;open side&rdquo;&rpar;, whilst making it difficult for them to throw in 
                the opposite direction &lpar;the &ldquo;break side&rdquo;&rpar;. Downfield defenders make it hard for the receiving players to get free on the open&sol;force 
                side, knowing throws to the break side are less likely to be accurate. The space is divided in this way because it is very hard for 
                the player marking the disc to stop every throw, and very hard for the downfield defenders to cover every space.
            </p>
            <p>
                The force can be decided by the defence before the point or during play. The most common force is a one&ndash;way force, either towards 
                the &ldquo;home&rdquo; side &lpar;where the team has their bags&sol;kit&rpar;, or &ldquo;away&rdquo;. Other forces are &ldquo;sideline&rdquo; 
                &lpar;force towards the closest sideline&rpar;, &ldquo;middle&rdquo; &lpar;force towards the center of the field&rpar;, &ldquo;straight 
                up&rdquo; &lpar;the force stands directly in front of the thrower &mdash; useful against long throwers&rpar;, or &ldquo;sidearm&sol;backhand&rdquo; 
                if one wishes their opponents to throw a particular throw. Another, more advanced marking technique is called the &ldquo;triangle mark&rdquo;. 
                This involves shuffling and drop stepping to take away throwing angles in an order that usually goes&colon; 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Take away shown throw &ldquo;inside&rdquo;</li>
                <li>Shuffle to take away 1st pivot &ldquo;around&rdquo;</li>
                <li>Drop step and shuffle to take away 2nd pivot</li>
                <li>Recover</li>
            </ol>
            <p>However, this marking technique is typically used to block long throws as well as force a certain side.</p>
            <h4 class="header" id="match">Match&ndash;to&ndash;Match</h4>
            <figure id="forcing">

                <figcaption>Marking with a force</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                The simplest defensive strategy is the <strong>match&ndash;to&ndash;match</strong> defense &lpar;also known as &ldquo;one&ndash;to&ndash;one&rdquo;, 
                &ldquo;person&ndash;to&ndash;person&rdquo;, or &ldquo;man defense&rdquo;&rpar;, where each defender guards a specific offensive player, 
                called their &ldquo;mark&rdquo;. This defense creates one&ndash;to&ndash;one matchups all over the field &mdash; if each defender shuts 
                out their mark, the team will likely earn a turn over. The defensive players will usually choose their mark at the beginning of the point 
                before the pull. Often players will mark the same person throughout the game, giving them an opportunity to pick up on their 
                opponent&apos;s strengths and weaknesses as they play.
            </p>
            <h4 class="header" id="poaching">Poaching</h4>
            <p>
                Poaching is a term used to describe one or more players temporarily leaving their match up to strategically cover space in an 
                otherwise person&ndash;to&ndash;person defensive scheme. Typical areas covered might be deep space &lpar;to defend long throws aimed at scoring 
                quickly&rpar;, near handlers &lpar;to narrow throwing lanes, making throws more difficult&rpar;, or leaving players who are less likely to 
                get the disc to help cover other areas of the field that are more likely to be directly attacked &lpar;such as moving closer to 
                the disc when the disc is trapped on one side of the field&rpar;.
            </p>
            <p>
                A common occurrence of poaching is when a player is accidentally open in a dangerous position. In this situation, it is 
                common for another player to temporarily cover him defensively to avoid a fast score. This is common when the deepest 
                person of the defense sees someone running past him, without a defender catching up to him, and it might be considered 
                obligatory to run and cover the player open deep.
            </p>
            <p>Players may also leave their match to cover throwing lanes, particularly if they are marking a reset or alternative handler.</p>
            <h4 class="header" id="zone">Zone</h4>
            <p>
                With a zone defensive strategy, the defenders cover an area rather than a specific person. The area they cover varies 
                depending on the particular zone they are playing, and the position of the disc. Zone defense is frequently used in poor 
                weather conditions, as it can pressure the offense into completing more passes, or the thrower into making bigger or 
                harder throws. Zone defence is also effective at neutralising the deep throw threat from the offense. A zone defense 
                usually has two components&colon;
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Number of players who stay close to the disc and attempt to contain the offenses&apos; ability to pass and move 
                    forward &lpar;a &ldquo;cup&rdquo; or &ldquo;wall&rdquo;&rpar;
                </li>
                <li>Number of players spaced out further from the disc, ready to bid on overhead or longer throws.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 class="header" id="cup">Cup</h4>
            <figure id="breaking_cup">
                <img src="Images/cup.jpeg" alt="player breaking a cup">
                <figcaption>An offensive player tries to play through a three&ndash;person cup defense during an informal game</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                The cup involves three players, arranged in a semi&ndash;circular cup&ndash;shaped formation, one in the middle and back, 
                the other two on the sides and forward. One of the side players marks the handler with a force, while the 
                other two guard the open side. Therefore, the handler will normally have to throw into the cup, allowing 
                the defenders to more easily make blocks. With a cup, usually the center cup blocks the up&ndash;field lane to 
                cutters, while the side cup blocks the cross&ndash;field swing pass to other handlers. The center cup usually 
                also has the responsibility to call out which of the two sides should mark the thrower, usually the defender 
                closest to the sideline of the field. The idea of the cup is to force the offense to attempt risky throws 
                through and around the cup that have low rates of completion. The cup &lpar;except the marker&rpar; must also remember 
                to stay 3 meters or more away from the offensive player with the disc. The only time a player in the cups 
                can come within 3 meters of the player with the disc is when another offensive player comes within 3 meters 
                of the person with the disc, also known as &ldquo;crashing the cup&rdquo;. When the second offensive player moves 
                further than 3 meters away, the members of the cup &lpar;except the marker&rpar; must go back to being 3 meters or 
                more away from the player with the disc.
            </p>
            <h4 class="header" id="wall">Wall</h4>
            <p>
                The &ldquo;wall&rdquo; sometimes referred to as the &ldquo;1&ndash;3&ndash;3&rdquo; involves four players in the close defense. One player is 
                the marker, also called the &ldquo;rabbit&rdquo;, &ldquo;chaser&rdquo; or &ldquo;puke&rdquo; because they often have to run quickly between 
                multiple handlers spread out across the field. The other three defenders form a horizontal &ldquo;wall&rdquo; or line 
                across the field in front of the handler to stop throws to short in&ndash;cuts and prevent forward progress. 
                The players in the second group of a zone defense, called &ldquo;mids&rdquo; and &ldquo;deeps&rdquo;, position themselves further 
                out to stop throws that escape the cup and fly upfield. A variation of the 1&ndash;3&ndash;3 is to have two markers&colon; 
                The &ldquo;rabbit&rdquo; marks in the middle third and strike side third of the field. The goal is for the &ldquo;rabbit&rdquo; 
                to trap the thrower and collapse a cup around her or him. If the rabbit is broken for large horizontal 
                yardage, or if the disc reaches the break side third of the field, the break side defender of the front 
                wall marks the throw. In this variation the force is directed one way. This variation plays to the 
                strength of a superior marking &ldquo;rabbit&rdquo;.
            </p>
            <h4 class="header" id="junk_clam">Junk and Clam</h4>
            <p>
                A junk defense is a defense using elements of both zone and match defenses&semi; the most well&ndash;known is the &ldquo;clam&rdquo; or 
                &ldquo;chrome wall&rdquo;. In clam defenses, defenders cover cutting lanes rather than zones of the field or individual 
                players. It is so named because, when played against a vertical stack, it is often disguised by lining up in 
                a traditional person defense and right before play starts, defenders spread out to their zonal positions, forming 
                the shape of an opening clam. The clam can be used by several players on a team while the rest are running a 
                match defense. Typically, a few defenders play match on the throwers while the cutter defenders play as &ldquo;flats&rdquo;, 
                taking away in cuts by guarding their respective areas, or as the &ldquo;deep&rdquo; or &ldquo;monster&rdquo;, taking away any deep throws.
            </p>
            <p>
                This defensive strategy is often referred to as &ldquo;bait and switch&rdquo;. In this case, when the two players the defenders 
                are covering are standing close to each other in the stack, one defender will move over to cover them deep, and 
                the other will move slightly more towards the thrower. When one of the receivers makes a deep cut, the first 
                defender picks them up, and if one makes an in&ndash;cut, the second defender covers them. The defenders communicate 
                and switch their marks if their respective charges change their cuts from in to deep, or vice versa. The clam 
                can also be used by the entire team, with different defenders covering in cuts, deep cuts, break side cuts, and dump cuts.
            </p>
            <p>
                The term &ldquo;junk defense&rdquo; is also often used to refer to zone defenses in general &lpar;or to zone defense applied by the 
                defending team momentarily, before switching to a match defense&rpar;, especially by members of the attacking team 
                before they have determined which exact type of zone defense they are facing.
            </p>
            <h4 class="header" id="bracket">Bracket</h4>
            <p>
                Bracket defenses are almost exclusively used on vertical stack offences, and incorporate elements of both zone and match 
                defence. In bracket defense, the handlers are covered by match defence, and the only changes are when marking the 
                cutters. Once the stack has set up, one player &lpar;the &ldquo;deep&rdquo; or &ldquo;monster&rdquo;&rpar; will set up a defence on the back of the 
                stack. Simultaneously, a defensive player &lpar;known as the &ldquo;under&rdquo;&rpar; will set up between the front of the stack and 
                the handler with the disc. The rest of the defence will set up a match defence on the players in the stack. When 
                play begins, any cutters who try to go for a long throw will be covered by the &ldquo;deep&rdquo;, and any cutters who try 
                to go towards the handler will be covered by the &ldquo;under&rdquo;. This defence attempts to force the offence into 1&ndash;on&ndash;1 
                situations with the strongest defensive players.
            </p>
            <h4 class="header" id="hasami">Hasami</h4>
            <p>
                Hasami, the Japanese word for &ldquo;scissors&rdquo;, is a popular hybrid person/zone defence used by the Japanese women&apos;s team 
                who won gold at WUGC 2012. The name refers to the method of using two pairs of defenders to cut the area downfield 
                into sections, with defenders responsible for space &ldquo;under&rdquo; &lpar;nearer the disc&rpar; and &ldquo;away&rdquo; &lpar;towards 
                the end zone&rpar;, and also the left and right areas of the field. Defenders rely on visual and verbal communication to switch and 
                cover the offensive threats between them. Hasami forms the basis of most Japanese style zone defences.
            </p>
            <h4 class="header" id="hexagon_flexagon">Hexagon or Flexagon</h4>
            <p>
                A separate type of defense is hexagon or &ldquo;flexagon&rdquo;, which incorporates elements of both match&ndash;to&ndash;match and zonal 
                defense. All defenders are encouraged to communicate, to sandwich their opponents and switch marks wherever 
                appropriate, and to ensure no opposing player is left unmarked.

                All youth and most club ultimate games are self&ndash;officiated through the &ldquo;spirit of the game&rdquo;, often 
                abbreviated SOTG. Spirit of the game is described by WFDF as an expectation that each player will 
                be a good sport and play fair, as well as having high values of integrity&semi; including &ldquo;following 
                and enforcing the rules&rdquo;. Another example is the practice of the players &ldquo;taking a knee,&rdquo; i.e., 
                kneeling on one knee, during the timeout when a player suffers an injury&semi; as a sign of respect 
                to the injured. SOTG is further contextualized and described in the rules established by 
                USA Ultimate&semi; according to The Official Rules of Ultimate, 11<sup>th</sup> Edition&colon;

            <p>
                Many tournaments give awards for the most spirited teams and&sol;or players, often based on 
                ratings provided by opposing teams. The largest youth ultimate tournament in the world, Spring 
                Reign, uses spirit scores to award a spirit prize within each pool and to determine eligibility 
                of teams the following year. In many non&ndash;professional games, it is common for teams to meet 
                after the game in a &ldquo;spirit circle&rdquo; to discuss the game, and in some cases grant individual spirit awards.
            </p>
            <p>
                While &ldquo;spirit of the game&rdquo; is a general attitude, ultimate has an agreed upon procedure to deal 
                with unclear or disputed situations.</p>
            <p>
                In Europe and other continents, even top&ndash;level play does not have referees. Most world 
                championship games have had no referees, and disputes were decided by the players themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                Observers are used in some high&ndash;level tournaments outside the US, as well as in some 
                tournaments sanctioned by USA Ultimate. Calls and disputes are initially handled by the 
                players, but observers step in if no agreement is reached. In some settings, officials use 
                a stopwatch to track the stall count and the defending players are not counting the stall.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other forms of refereeing exist in ultimate. Professional ultimate in North America uses 
                referees, in part to increase the pace of the game. Game Advisors are used in some 
                international competitions, though calls and final decisions remain in control of the on&ndash;field players.

            <p>
                North America has the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Ultimate_Disc_League" target="_blank">American Ultimate Disc League &lpar;AUDL&rpar;</a>, 
                a men&apos;s professional&ndash;level ultimate league that involve teams from the United States and Canada and the 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_Ultimate_League" target="_blank">Premier Ultimate League &lpar;PUL&rpar;</a>, a women&apos;s 
                professional&ndash;league that involves teams from the United States and South America.
            </p>
            <p>
                The AUDL was founded by Josh Moore and its inaugural season began in April 2012. In 2013 the league was 
                bought by Ultimate Xperience Ventures LLC, a company founded by Rob Lloyd who was serving as 
                VP of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco" target="_blank">Cisco</a> 
                but has since become the CEO of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperloop" target="_blank">Hyperloop</a>. In 2012 
                the league began with eight teams, but currently 
                consists of 22 teams in four divisions &lpar;East, South, Midwest, and West&rpar;. Since the league&apos;s inaugural 
                season, they have added 24 new teams and had 10 teams fold. Only two of the original eight teams 
                remain in the league &lpar;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Mechanix" target="_blank">Detroit Mechanix</a> and 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_AlleyCats" target="_blank">Indianapolis AlleyCats</a>&rpar;. Each team plays a total of 14 
                regular season games on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday during the months of April through July. 
                In late July there are playoffs in each division followed by a championship weekend held the 
                first weekend in August. The AUDL uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discraft" target="_blank">Discraft</a> Ultrastar as the official game disc. The 
                team funding comes from sources similar to those of other professional sports&colon; sales of tickets, 
                merchandise, concessions and sponsorship. In 2014, the league entered an agreement with ESPN 
                to broadcast 18 games per season for a two&ndash;year period &lpar;with a third year option&rpar; on the 
                online streaming service ESPN3. That contract was executed by Fulcrum Media Group.

            <p>
                There used to be a rival league named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Ultimate" target="_blank">Major League Ultimate &lpar;MLU&rpar;</a>. 
                Active between 2013 and 2016, it had eight teams, and was considered the main alternative to the AUDL, until it closed down. 
                It used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innova_Champion_Discs" target="_blank">Innova</a> Pulsar as the official game disc.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2018, there was a planned mixed league called the United Ultimate League &lpar;UUL&rpar;, but it 
                did not come to fruition due to a lack of funding. The plan was to present an alternative to the 
                AUDL, which at the time was dealing with a boycott related to gender equality. The UUL was supposed 
                to be supported by crowd sourced funding, but the initial Kickstarter failed, raising only &#36;23,517 of the &#36;50,000 goal.

                The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_Ultimate_League" target="_blank">Premier Ultimate League &lpar;PUL&rpar;</a> was 
                established in 2019. The league includes women and nonbinary players and hosts teams from the United States 
                and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia" target="_blank">Colombia</a>. The PUL is a 501&lpar;c&rpar;6 nonprofit that 
                is operated by a board of directors that includes representatives from each of the participating 
                teams. The mission of PUL is &ldquo;to achieve equity in the sport of ultimate by increasing accessibility 
                to and visibility of women&ast; players through high&ndash;quality competition, leadership experiences, and

                There have been a small number of children&apos;s leagues. The largest and first known pre&ndash;high school 
                league was started in 1993 by Mary Lowry, Joe Bisignano, and Jeff Jorgenson in

            <h3 class="header" id="hat_tournaments">Hat Tournaments</h3>
            <p>
                Hat tournaments are common in the ultimate circuit. At these tournaments players join 
                individually rather than as a team. The tournament organizers form teams by randomly 
                taking the names of the participants from a hat. This sort of procedure is an excellent 
                way to meet people from all skill levels.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many hat tournaments on the US west coast have a &ldquo;hat rule&rdquo; requiring all players to 
                wear a hat at all times during play. If a player gains possession of the disc, yet 
                loses her or his hat in the process, the play is considered a turnover and possession 
                of the disc reverts to the other team.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, in some tournaments, the organizers do not actually use a hat, but form teams 
                while taking into account skill, experience, sex, age, height, and fitness level of the 
                players in the attempt to form teams of even strength. Many times the random element 
                remains, so that organizers randomly pick players from each level for each team, combining a 
                lottery with skill matching. Usually, the player provides this information when he or she 
                signs up to enter the tournament. There are also many cities that run hat leagues, structured 
                like a hat tournament, but where the group of players stay together over the course of a season.
